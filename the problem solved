first cuda version:
  have to make sure the version of system installed cuda, nvcc, torch.version.cuda, are same. unless the building of cuda codes will meet some
  problem. even the building is completed, during the using wiff occur some symbol not defined.
missing _mask:
  happend because the coco. have to place the coco code into the data folder. and make it.
the torch version:
  some code not support torch 1.0. the error occured: torch.utils.ffi is deprecated. How do I use cpp extensions instead.
  the solvment is using faster rcnn code of torch 1.0 banch in authors repositorie.
