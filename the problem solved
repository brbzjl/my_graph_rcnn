first cuda version:
  have to make sure the version of system installed cuda, nvcc, torch.version.cuda, are same. or the building of cuda codes will meet some
  problems. even the building is completed, during the using occur error: some symbol not defined.
 export CUDA_HOME = /the cuda used in your environment
missing _mask:
  happend because of the coco. have to place the coco code into the data folder. and make it.
the torch version:
  some codes don't support torch 1.0. the error occured: torch.utils.ffi is deprecated. using cpp extensions instead.
  the solvment is using the faster rcnn code of torch 1.0 banch in authors repositorie.
